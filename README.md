### Clarification for UTR annotations of transcriptome_v5
UTR annotations were downloaded from YeastMine on July 3, 2017, which included annotations from Yassour (2009), Xu (2009), Miura (2006), Zhang (2005), and Nagalakshmi (2008). In cases where a given gene was associated with multiple UTRs in this database, the longest entry was chosen. The final UTRs and their associated sources are provided in 5prime_UTR_summary_updated.txt and 3prime_UTR_summary_updated.txt. For the purpose of ribosome profiling footprint P-site analysis by riboWaltz and downstream analysis, the stop codon is considered as a part of the 3’-UTR region rather than the CDS region, thus the length of CDS and 3’-UTR regions of each gene were adjusted accordingly by 3 bases.
